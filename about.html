            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to visit my site.<p>
            <br/>
            <p>My name is Ian and I am an undergraduate in the National University of Singapore, majoring in Business Analytics. I currently live on campus at Residential College 4, where I am a member of several student interest groups.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I have a keen interest in many topics spanning multiple domains and this website is meant as a means for me to structure, document and showcase my interests and accomplishments.</p>

            <h2 class="right">About This Website</h2>
            <p>This website was created by me in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is by no means my most accomplished project, nor is it the first iteration of IANS.IM as I historically had a personal site which I created when I was 16. Please feel free to look around and do contact me for any feedback about the site or if you just want to say hi!</p>
