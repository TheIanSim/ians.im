            <p>My fascination with science and technology started at a young age, and since then has only evolved. This page aims to highlight some of my recent fascinations and skills with regard to technology.<p>

            <h2>Blockchain & Distributed Ledger</h2>
            <p>My foray into Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies is a relatively recent one, although I did mine Bitcoins for a while back in 2014, I never really did look into the specifics of the technology until this year.<p>
            <br/>
            <p>I am also currently developing a distributed ledger for medical records using Hyperledger Fabric as part of a group project for a school module and look forward posting the end result on this page when it is complete.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Web Development</h2>
            <p>I have been interested in web design and web development since secondary school and have since then, further expanded my web-dev toolbox to include frameworks such as React, Redux, Meteor, Firebase and NodeJS.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Some of my projects such as my Telegram PointsBot has been used during actual school events such as the School of Computing's Freshman Social Camp and Freshman orientation week.</p>
