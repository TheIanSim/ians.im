            <p>My interest in finance primarily lies within the personal wealth management and growth areas. In my opinion, it is crucial for individuals to have some degree of financial literacy, something I find sorely lacking among my peers. I have been investing since 16 and am always on the look-out for new potential opportunities that may present themselves.<p>

            <h2>Property & Real Estate</h2>
            <p>I have a keen interest in the property market, especially in Singapore, where the prices of residential real estate have soared in recent years. I frequent  property listing websites as well as check actual property transaction caveats to keep updated. I also enjoy helping friends and family to look for new homes, regardless of it being for personal stay or for investment purposes.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Additionally, I am currently looking to overseas properties as potential investment opportunities as I feel that the potential for capital growth in Singapore is limited due to the high prices.</p>

            <h2 class="right">CryptoCurrency & ICOs</h2>
            <p>Recently, as part of my blockchain and distributed ledger technologies module, I was introduced to the relatively recent phenomenon of initial coin offerings or ICOs. After doing some research, I am deeply concerned about the nature of such "investments". It seems that a great deal of money is being allocated into companies which offer little to no potential returns on these investment tokens and furthermore, many of them do not even have an actual product or revenue stream yet.</p>

            <h2>Stocks & Derivatives</h2>
            <p>Having been in the stock market for several years, I maintain a portfolio with a risk profile which I deem comfortable. It consists mainly of index funds with a small portion being put aside for higher risk trades. Additionally, I am currently exploring the derivatives market as not only a way to hedge my trades but also for potentially higher returns.</p>
