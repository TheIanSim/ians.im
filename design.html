            <p>It is my belief that anything that can be done beautifully, should. Design should not only be constrained to pieces of art but be present in everything that we do. From presentation slides to formatting reports, good design can go a long way.<p>

            <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
            <p>The presentation of data in a way that is not only informative but also intuitive is critical in order to be able to properly generate insights. As someone who enjoys and appreciates beautiful design, I try to incorporate some element of aesthetics in any visualization I do.<p>
            <br/>
            <p>The images on the right showcase a dashboard that I did during a data visualization module in which we had to create a way to display healthcare data for healthcare professionals. The dashboard was done in Tableau.</p>

            <h2 class="right">3D Modelling</h2>
            <p>Architecture is another interest of mine and I enjoy looking at and thinking of new designs for buildings. My interest lies primarily in residential architecture and as such, I have used 3D modelling software such as Sketchup to create 3D models of houses. </p>

            <h2>UI / UX Design</h2>
            <p>A big part of developing websites and web apps involves the overall user experience and user interface. I am very much a fan of minimalist designs such as the one seen in this website and regularly take inspiration from other websites and apps.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I generally use UI mockup software such as Adobe XD to create high fidelity mockups before committing to a design.</p>
